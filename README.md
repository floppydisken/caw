# Introduction

A C++20 project to test out meson build system, with conan and clangd in
neovim.

caw converts any string input into a hexadeximal representatio, wac then
converts that stream into a readable string again. So a "to hexadecimal to
string" converter suite.

Not meant to be used for anything other than testing and exploration. Next up,
how do we install a library from conan and get autocompletion for it?
